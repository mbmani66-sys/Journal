eighteen feb did so many NIIT tasks
in that used cloud formation by creating a template so its simple i just have 
to create a yaml file and put the cloud formation template which will create
or operate any aws resource which we want. 
so I created S3 temp which clearly creates a S3 bucket, same for ECtwo sec 
group 

but while creating the sec group elatic ip and public ipv4 creation
i have to provide the ami image id and subnet id in that yaml file

so it will create the and manage the resources which helps us error free and 
time saving. 

next was to install ansible 
and then need to create a vagrant file which give by niit was a failure and
old file so i was unable to up the vagrant then all the remaining task went 
unperformed lik creating invetory and putting the adresses and ansible play
book to install the packages so need to try it seperately. 

then i knew nano editor very well but i forgot now recalled
ctrl o is save then click enter 
then ctrl x is exit from the file 

then one more mistake in yaml file i created the directory and didn't put the 
yaml insite the file so it didn't work
