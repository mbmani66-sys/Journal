ninth feb visited library to study for the mock interview questions
took a book named ninty seven things a cloud engineer should know very first
line explained about what is cloud computing which means ondemand delivery of 
computer system resources like storage db computing power and software over 
the internet stuck with the first work itself what is computer system resorce
its nothing but a physical and vitual components phsyical has the hardware 
like storage cpu memory peripheral and virtual is the software components like the os
files db network bandwidth tables then after studying these my whole mind went
into what is actually os because it is said the os system only manages the 
both computer system resources but os belongs to one of the category which
is a software computer system resource how a software resources manages the 
other hardware resources is my first question because that is what exactly 
the os is doing which acts as an interface btw the user and the hardware comp
aagain the ques popped tha what are these interface what word is this 
Interface its also nothing but helps as a connection point that
 enables communicaiton data exchange btw devices , systems , softwares.
 which is classified into three types two I already knew UI which is GUI
and CLI and hard harware interfaces likes cables connectors physical 
ports
 Softare application programming interface API then I cam to the diff quess
in the mock call Rest API represtational state transfer API 
now answere is again very simple we gonna build a API that is app 
programming interface by susing a standard HTTP method again same
to enable a communication data exchange in between the systems suing internet
then next ques is httpd status code whats this nothing but a three digit code sent from server to client in clarity we search something that 
Input from client on some website link to the server now sever will comm
to us with three digit code classified as 5 types of meaning one two three 
four five i didnt dig deep after that left the lib no main topic is system
server resource aws resources and these httpd classfi 




Eleven feb 
Task in NIIT was to creat virtual networks in AWS
Where I created a vpc and created six diff subnets 
Two public subnets two private subnets and two db private subnets

Then created a private rt and associated private subnets with it and allocated elastic ip
Same for public too

Then natgateway created and added the public rt
And private rt with nat route

Create lb sg and add inbound rules
Then app server sg add inbound for https to lb sg
And finally db server sg to https app server sg 

Then create log flow from vpc and cloud trail for monitoring
